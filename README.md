# Text-Based Resume Evaluation using Google Gemini Pro

##  How It Works

1. **User Inputs**:
   - Paste a **Job Description** in the input area.
   - Upload a **PDF resume**.

2. **Text Extraction**:
   - The PDF file is read using `PyMuPDF`.
   - Full text content is extracted from the resume.

3. **Prompt Generation**:
   - Based on user selection, a specific prompt is generated for Gemini Pro:
     - Resume review
     - Skill gap analysis
     - Match percentage

4. **Gemini Pro Analysis**:
   - Gemini Pro receives the text-based resume and job description.
   - The model returns detailed, natural language feedback.

5. **Output**:
   - The AI's response is displayed clearly in the app window.

##  Sample Prompt Templates Used

- ‚ÄúAct like an ATS and evaluate this resume text based on the job description...‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhat skills are missing in this resume when compared to the job description?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúProvide a percentage match based on the resume and the job requirements.‚Äù

##  Limitations

- Only supports **PDF resumes**.
- Assumes resumes are **text-based PDFs** (scanned image-based resumes will not work).
- Gemini Pro's API usage limits apply.

##  Requirements File (`requirements.txt`)

```
streamlit
python-dotenv
google-generativeai

```

##  Future Improvements

- Add support for `.docx` and `.txt` resume formats.
- Include keyword highlighting from job description in the resume.
- Save results in a downloadable format (PDF or DOC).
